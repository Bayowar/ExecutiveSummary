    <h3>Examining the relationship between air pollution, socioeconomic status and cardiovascular mortality rates and determining if air pollution and socioeconomic status influence cardiovascular mortality rates in the U.S.</h3>
    <p>Disparities in air pollution exposure have increasingly drawn attention as a public health and social justice issue. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a pollutant linked to industrial activity and human activity, has been shown to elevate risks for cardiovascular disease mortality, especially among populations in economically disadvantaged communities (Crouse et al., 2012; Di et al., 2017). Our research investigates whether there is a statistical relationship between cardiovascular disease mortality rates (CMR) and long-term PM2.5 exposure, and whether socioeconomic status influences this relationship. This analysis applies a data science framework to assess patterns, focusing on the intersection of environmental burden and socioeconomic factors. This study contributes to the growing body of research emphasizing the need for social justice policies that protect vulnerable populations and address health disparities driven by structural inequality. <a href="https://github.com/Bayowar/CMRPM25Research.git">link here</a>.</p>
